# QA sub-agent for system/integration; /agn:validate skills at every level


## Problem statement

Today validation runs in the same context as implementation. The agent that wrote the code also tests it, inheriting implicit context that may have biased its design choices. A QA sub-agent with fresh context, validating against specs only, catches issues the implementer overlooks.

## Objective

QA sub-agent handles feature/epic/product validation. Lightweight `/agn:validate task` skill runs in main session for task-level quality gates. Both wire to `rules/qa.md`.

## Acceptance criteria

- QA sub-agent file exists; loads `rules/qa.md`.
- `/agn:validate task` runs task-level quality gates in main session (lightweight; no sub-agent).
- `/agn:validate feature`, `/agn:validate epic`, `/agn:validate product` invoke the QA sub-agent.
- QA sub-agent receives spec + implementation result only; no implementer-decision context.
- QA produces verdict + report; failures surface specific findings to user.
- Existing `/agn:qa-integration` and `/agn:qa-system` content migrated into the new skills (logic preserved; entry-point changes).

## Scope

In scope: QA sub-agent; four `/agn:validate <level>` skills; migration of qa-integration and qa-system logic.

Out of scope: authoring `rules/qa.md` (covered by `rules_split_and_new_files`).

## Tasks

- `create_qa_subagent`
- `create_validate_task_skill`
- `create_validate_feature_epic_product_skills`
- `migrate_qa_skills_logic`

## Summary

### Steps completed

1. Authored `plugins/agn/agents/qa.md` (~110 lines) — second sub-agent in the plugin. Fresh-context validator. System prompt loads `rules/qa.md`, documents brief contract (level, scope, spec_paths, implementation_paths, regression_scope), per-level expectations (feature/epic/product), structured output contract (Verdict / Per-requirement results / Issues by severity / What I fixed / What I escalated / Report / Next steps). Full tool set (Read/Bash/Write/Edit) since QA needs to run tests and apply in-scope glue fixes — the role boundary lives in the prompt + rules.
2. Filled in `/agn:validate task` placeholder with a 5-step main-session workflow: read task → run each gate → report per-gate pass/fail → offer (do not auto-execute) move-to-done → stop. No QA sub-agent at this level — narrow gates with parent context.
3. Added top-level "Validation via the QA sub-agent" section to `validate/SKILL.md` documenting the brief, the output contract, and the halt-on-not-ready rule.
4. Refactored `/agn:validate feature` to delegate to QA; resolve scope + gather paths in the parent; surface QA verdict; halt on not ready; offer `feature close` only on ready.
5. Filled in `/agn:validate epic` placeholder with parallel workflow: precondition that all linked features are done, gather cross-feature spec + implementation paths, delegate to QA, surface verdict, offer `epic close` on ready.
6. Refactored `/agn:validate product` to delegate to QA with explicit Critical/Major/Minor brief; supports re-run loop; user-owned sign-off gate.
7. Audited the qa-integration / qa-system migration. Confirmed every capability has a documented home (parent for context capture + lifecycle offers; sub-agent for execution + categorization + reports). No live docs reference the obsolete skill names.
8. Updated docs: `CLAUDE.md` (in-flight section moved from 4-of-6 → 5-of-6 shipped; "Editing agents" expanded to list both `planner` and `qa`); `plugins/agn/README.md` (skill table + plugin layout); `docs/agn-specification.md` (in-flight section + sub-agents listing).

### Changes made

Created:
- `plugins/agn/agents/qa.md`

Modified:
- `plugins/agn/skills/validate/SKILL.md` (1 YAML edit + 1 new top-level section + 4 branch refactors)
- `CLAUDE.md` (in-flight section + Editing agents section expansion)
- `plugins/agn/README.md` (validate row in skill table + plugin layout)
- `docs/agn-specification.md` (in-flight section + sub-agents bullet)

Task files:
- 4 tasks created, finalized, executed, closed under `tasks/done/20260526_*.md`.

### Notable decisions or deviations

- **Sub-agent isolation is by context, not tool restriction.** QA gets full tools (Read/Bash/Write/Edit) — the fresh-context property is what enforces the QA role, not what tools it can use. Compare with the Planner, which has read-only tools because its job depends on not writing. Different agents, different constraint patterns — both honest.
- **Task level is intentionally not delegated.** Task gates are narrow and the parent session has the right context. Forcing delegation would lose context for negligible benefit. Documented inline in the task-branch Discipline so the choice is durable.
- **Halt on not-ready, in every branch.** No automatic lifecycle advancement when QA says not ready. The skill cannot offer `feature close`, `epic close`, or release sign-off until QA approves. Forces user triage rather than letting state advance silently.
- **Epic precondition: all linked features in `done`.** Epic validation is about cross-feature interactions — partial features make the validation premature. Skill enforces this before invoking QA.
- **Re-run loop only for product.** Feature and epic have natural single-invocation cycles (fix issues → re-validate at the appropriate level → next). Product validation runs against release-candidate snapshots; multiple invocations against the same snapshot make sense.
- **QA report file paths are recommended, not enforced.** `docs/integration/<feature-slug>-test-report.md`, `docs/integration/epic-<slug>-test-report.md`, `docs/system/system-test-report.md`. The user can override; QA picks up the override from the brief.
- **No code changes for the migration audit.** It was a verification task — the migration itself happened in feature 1, and the sub-agent delegation in this feature's sibling task. The audit recorded the mapping per original capability as proof of preservation.

### Risk surfaced

The QA sub-agent invocation, like the Planner's, relies on `subagent_type: qa` resolution at the Claude Code runtime layer. First real `/agn:validate feature` invocation will exercise this path. If plugin-namespaced agent names need a prefix, that single string change covers both agents.
