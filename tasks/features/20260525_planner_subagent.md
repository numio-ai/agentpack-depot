# Planner sub-agent for Design + Plan; define and refinement skills delegate


## Problem statement

`/agn:define <level>` skills today bundle Design and Plan in the main session, loading all composition rules into the parent context. A level-aware Planner sub-agent encapsulates Design + Plan, isolates rules from the parent context, and produces design rationale plus work-unit files.

## Objective

One Planner sub-agent serves Design + Plan at every tier. Define skills delegate to it. Standalone `/agn:design <level>` and `/agn:plan <level>` skills exist for revising existing units.

## Acceptance criteria

- Single Planner sub-agent file exists; system prompt covers Design + Plan rules for all applicable tiers.
- `/agn:define <level>` invokes the Planner. User dialog flows through the parent session.
- Planner outputs persist via `taskman.sh` (script remains the only file writer).
- `/agn:design <level>` and `/agn:plan <level>` invoke the same Planner for focused revisions of existing work units.
- Refinement skills do not require creating new units — they operate on existing files.

## Scope

In scope: Planner sub-agent; refactor of define skills to delegate; new standalone design/plan refinement skills.

Out of scope: escalation protocol; task validation; doc sync (sibling features).

## Tasks

- `create_planner_subagent`
- `refactor_define_skills_to_delegate`
- `create_design_skill`
- `create_plan_skill`

## Summary

### Steps completed

1. Authored `plugins/agn/agents/planner.md` (~120 lines) — first sub-agent in the plugin. Establishes the `agents/` directory, the brief contract (`level`, `mode`, `title`, `initial_scope`, `upstream`), the output contract (`## Body`, `## Decomposition`, optional `## Questions for parent`), per-level guidance (product/epic/feature/task), and hard constraints (no Write/Edit/Bash, no taskman.sh, no direct user questions, one unit per invocation).
2. Refactored `plugins/agn/skills/define/SKILL.md`. Added a top-level "Composition via the Planner sub-agent" section documenting the brief and output shape once. Replaced inline body-composition steps in epic, feature, task, and bug-task branches with delegation pointers. Product branch unchanged (vision/spec/requirements are pre-Design — not the Planner's mandate).
3. Wired `plugins/agn/skills/design/SKILL.md`. Replaced epic and feature placeholders with 6-step in-place refinement workflows (Locate → Identify gap → Delegate → Review → Persist via Edit → Report). Product branch's architecture.md flow unchanged.
4. Wired `plugins/agn/skills/plan/SKILL.md`. Replaced epic and feature placeholders with re-decomposition workflows. Each branch surfaces in-flight children (active/done) before proposing changes; persistence uses the right channel per change type (new child → `/agn:define`; obsolete draft → `taskman.sh discard`; ordering → direct Edit).
5. Updated three docs (`CLAUDE.md`, `plugins/agn/README.md`, `docs/agn-specification.md`): "in flight" section moved from 2-of-6 → 3-of-6 shipped; skill descriptions updated (no longer "placeholders pending Planner"); plugin layout now shows `agents/`; CLAUDE.md gained an "Editing agents" section.

### Changes made

Created:
- `plugins/agn/agents/` (new directory)
- `plugins/agn/agents/planner.md`

Modified:
- `plugins/agn/skills/define/SKILL.md` (6 surgical edits)
- `plugins/agn/skills/design/SKILL.md` (3 edits — YAML description + 2 placeholders)
- `plugins/agn/skills/plan/SKILL.md` (3 edits — YAML description + 2 placeholders)
- `CLAUDE.md` (in-flight section + new "Editing agents" section)
- `plugins/agn/README.md` (skill table + plugin layout)
- `docs/agn-specification.md` (in-flight section + ships-today bullets + new sub-agents bullet)

Task files:
- 4 tasks created, finalized, executed, and closed under `tasks/done/20260526_*.md`.

### Notable decisions or deviations

- **Product branch intentionally excluded from Planner delegation in `/agn:define`.** Vision/spec/requirements drafting is pre-Design — the Planner's mandate starts at architecture (which lives in `/agn:design product`). Documented inline in the define skill so future readers don't add product delegation by mistake.
- **`Questions for parent` escape hatch.** Sub-agents cannot ask the user directly; the Planner returns questions as a section in its output, the parent relays them, then re-invokes. Avoids the "sub-agent guesses silently" failure mode.
- **One unit per Planner invocation.** Decomposition entries become sibling Planner invocations from the parent, not a single mega-call. Keeps each sub-agent context focused and predictable.
- **`/agn:plan` doesn't touch bodies; `/agn:design` doesn't touch decomposition.** Each branch in plan/SKILL.md and design/SKILL.md explicitly redirects out-of-scope requests to the sibling skill. Prevents the two skills from drifting into the same job.
- **Persistence channels for plan refinement are multi-mode** (new children via `/agn:define`, obsolete drafts via `taskman.sh discard`, ordering via direct Edit). Each path is the simplest valid one — no new unified API needed.
- **Tools restricted on the Planner agent.** No Write, Edit, Bash, TodoWrite, KillShell, BashOutput. Only read-only tools (Read, Glob, Grep, LS, NotebookRead, WebFetch, WebSearch). Enforces the "taskman.sh is the sole writer" rule at the tool level, not just by convention.

### Risk surfaced

The Planner sub-agent's invocation mechanism uses `subagent_type: planner` via the Agent tool. The exact resolution of plugin-namespaced agent names (e.g., whether `planner` or `agn:planner` is the right string) is a Claude Code runtime detail that wasn't verified empirically in this session — the skill bodies document it abstractly. First real `/agn:define epic` invocation will exercise this path and reveal any naming issue.
