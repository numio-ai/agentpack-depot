# Wire plan skill to Planner

# Wire plan skill to Planner

## Problem statement

`/agn:plan epic` and `/agn:plan feature` are placeholders pending the Planner. They should re-decompose an existing epic into features or an existing feature into tasks by delegating to the Planner in refine mode with plan-only intent.

## Scope

In scope:
- Edit `plugins/agn/skills/plan/SKILL.md`.
- Replace epic and feature placeholders with delegation steps that call the Planner with `mode=refine, level=<level>, scope=plan-only, path=<existing unit>`.
- Define the user-facing flow: locate existing unit → call Planner refine for decomposition → present new child list → user reviews → write children via taskman.sh.

Out of scope:
- Design refinement (covered by `create_design_skill`).
- The Planner system prompt.

## Acceptance criteria

- Epic branch delegates to Planner with plan-only intent.
- Feature branch delegates to Planner with plan-only intent.
- Decomposition revision creates new child units via taskman.sh; does not touch the parent file directly except to update `## Linked features` / `## Tasks` list.

## Quality gates

- Skill body parses; YAML frontmatter intact.
- Both branches have explicit dispatch logic.

## Summary

### Steps completed

1. Updated YAML `description` to reflect Planner delegation (no longer "once the planner_subagent feature ships").
2. Replaced epic placeholder with full re-decomposition workflow: Locate → Identify gap (surfaces current features per status folder) → Delegate to Planner (refine + plan-only) → User review → Persist (new features via `/agn:define feature` or `taskman.sh new feature`; obsolete drafts via `taskman.sh discard`; ordering via direct edit) → Report. Added Discipline notes (don't touch bodies, don't move features between folders).
3. Replaced feature placeholder with the parallel feature-level workflow (re-decomposes into tasks; same Locate/Identify/Delegate/Persist/Report shape).

### Changes made

Modified:
- `plugins/agn/skills/plan/SKILL.md` (3 surgical edits: YAML description + 2 placeholders)

### Notable decisions

- **Plan operates on decomposition only.** Bodies (Problem statement, Objective, Acceptance criteria) are out of scope — `/agn:design` owns those. Each branch explicitly redirects body-editing requests to `/agn:design <level>`.
- **In-flight items surfaced before changes.** Step 2 lists features/tasks already in `active` or `done` so the user knows what cannot be safely removed. Avoids the "Planner proposes deleting an in-flight task" foot-gun.
- **Persistence is multi-channel.** New children go through the right skill (`/agn:define feature/task`) for proper Planner-driven composition. Obsolete drafts use `discard`. Re-ordering is a direct edit on the parent file's list. Each path is the simplest valid one.
