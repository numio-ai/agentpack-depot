# Handle no-active-session fallback

# Handle no-active-session fallback

## Problem statement

When `taskman.sh close` runs from a direct CLI (no Claude session active), the queue accumulates but there is no automatic surfacing on the next session start. Users may forget to check. The fallback must make the queue durable and easy to surface either automatically (via opt-in Claude Code SessionStart hook) or manually (via any taskman interaction).

## Scope

In scope:
- Confirm queue file `tasks/docs-sync-queue.txt` persists across sessions (it's a plain file — automatic).
- Confirm `taskman.sh list` commands surface the pending-entries hint (covered by `design_postclose_hook` task).
- Document an opt-in Claude Code SessionStart hook snippet for users who want automatic surfacing. Provide as a copy-paste block in `plugins/agn/README.md` — not auto-installed.
- Document the queue format + manual processing in `taskman.sh help` and in `plugins/agn/README.md`.
- Add carve-out for `tasks/docs-sync-queue.txt` in CLAUDE.md "taskman.sh is the only writer" section (queue is an observability record, written by taskman.sh itself + cleared by `/agn:docs-sync`).

Out of scope:
- Auto-installing a SessionStart hook in the user's settings.json (not the plugin's place — user owns settings).
- Implementing the queue file itself (covered by sibling task).
- The `/agn:docs-sync` skill (covered by sibling task).

## Acceptance criteria

- README has a documented SessionStart hook snippet users can opt into.
- README + `taskman.sh help` document the queue file format.
- CLAUDE.md carve-out for the queue file matches the existing pattern used for `tasks/gaps/`.
- Confirmed (manually) that `taskman.sh list` after a CLI close shows the pending hint.

## Quality gates

- Documentation is concrete and self-contained — a user reading it can wire the hook without further reference.
- `taskman.sh validate` passes.

## Summary

### Steps completed

1. Confirmed queue file persistence is automatic — `tasks/docs-sync-queue.txt` is a plain file written by taskman.sh on every close.
2. Confirmed `taskman.sh list` surfaces the WARN hint when queue is non-empty (manually tested after the 3 task closes for this feature — hint correctly read "3 doc-sync entries pending").
3. Added a "PostClose hook and docs-sync" section to `plugins/agn/README.md` documenting the queue, the hint, and how to process via `/agn:docs-sync`.
4. Added "Optional: surface the queue at session start" subsection in `plugins/agn/README.md` with a copy-paste SessionStart hook snippet for users' `.claude/settings.json`. Hook prints the queue count if non-empty; opt-in (not auto-installed).
5. Added exception entry for `tasks/docs-sync-queue.txt` in CLAUDE.md "taskman.sh is the only writer" section. Aligned with the existing pattern used for `tasks/gaps/` — converted single-exception note to a list of two exceptions.
6. Queue format also documented in `taskman.sh help` under "DOC-SYNC QUEUE" (covered by sibling task `design_postclose_hook`).

### Changes made

Modified:
- `plugins/agn/README.md` (new "PostClose hook and docs-sync" section with SessionStart snippet)
- `CLAUDE.md` (carve-out for queue file added to existing exceptions list)

### Notable decisions

- **Opt-in SessionStart hook, not auto-installed.** Modifying the user's `settings.json` is the user's call, not the plugin's. The README provides the snippet; the user pastes it in if they want automatic surfacing. Without the hook, the queue still works — surfacing happens via `taskman.sh list`.
- **Single shell command in the SessionStart snippet.** Uses `test -s` (queue non-empty) + `wc -l` + `printf`. No external dependencies beyond standard POSIX tools. The `|| true` at the end keeps the hook's exit code clean even when the queue is empty.
- **Documented format in two places intentionally.** Queue format appears in `taskman.sh help` (the script reference) and `plugins/agn/README.md` (the user-facing onboarding doc). Same format, two audiences. Drift risk is low because the format is line-stable and trivial.
