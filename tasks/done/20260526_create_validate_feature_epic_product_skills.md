# Wire /agn:validate feature/epic/product to QA sub-agent

# Wire /agn:validate feature/epic/product to QA sub-agent

## Problem statement

Currently `/agn:validate feature` and `/agn:validate product` run inline in the main session (carrying the migrated qa-integration and qa-system workflows). `/agn:validate epic` is a placeholder. All three should delegate to the QA sub-agent so the validator sees spec + result without implementer reasoning.

## Scope

In scope:
- Edit `plugins/agn/skills/validate/SKILL.md`, `$0 = feature`, `$0 = epic`, `$0 = product` branches.
- For each branch: keep the user-facing context capture (scope, spec paths) in the parent session; delegate the actual validation execution to the QA sub-agent.
- Document the delegation contract: parent passes `{level, spec_paths, implementation_paths, scope_hint}` to QA; receives back `{verdict, per_requirement_results, issues_by_severity, recommended_next_steps}`.
- Preserve the migrated qa-integration logic in the feature branch and qa-system logic in the product branch — moved into the brief passed to QA.

Out of scope:
- Task branch (sibling task).
- QA sub-agent creation (sibling task).

## Acceptance criteria

- All three branches invoke the QA sub-agent via the Agent tool.
- Existing qa-integration / qa-system content preserved (now expressed as part of the QA brief, not inline skill instructions).
- Each branch reports the QA verdict to the user; halts on `not ready`.

## Quality gates

- Skill body parses; YAML frontmatter intact.
- Each of the 3 branches has explicit dispatch logic.

## Summary

### Steps completed

1. Added a new top-level "Validation via the QA sub-agent" section after Dispatch — documents the brief shape (level, scope, spec_paths, implementation_paths, regression_scope), the QA output contract, and the halt-on-not-ready rule.
2. Refactored `$0 = feature` branch: kept user-facing scope resolution + path gathering in the parent; delegation to QA; surface verdict; halt on not ready; offer `feature close` only on ready.
3. Replaced `$0 = epic` placeholder with full workflow: preconditions (all linked features must be done), read epic + linked features, gather paths (specs + implementation + regression scope), delegate to QA, surface verdict, halt or offer `epic close`.
4. Refactored `$0 = product` branch: gather paths (full spec set + full test suite + whole-product regression), delegate to QA with explicit Critical/Major/Minor categorization brief, surface verdict, halt on not ready, support re-run loop, user-owned sign-off gate.
5. Updated YAML description to drop "Feature and product use the migrated qa-integration / qa-system workflows" — now consistent with QA delegation across all non-task levels.

### Changes made

Modified:
- `plugins/agn/skills/validate/SKILL.md` (1 YAML edit + 1 new top-level section + 3 branch refactors)

### Notable decisions

- **Parent vs sub-agent split: context capture vs execution.** Parent does scope inference, path gathering, surfacing results, lifecycle offers. Sub-agent does spec reading, test execution, severity categorization, report writing. This matches the Planner pattern and keeps the "fresh context" property intact.
- **Halt on not ready.** No automatic lifecycle advancement. The skill cannot offer `feature close` or `epic close` when QA says not ready. Forces the user to triage rather than letting state advance silently.
- **Epic precondition: all linked features must be in `done`.** Epic-level validation is about cross-feature interactions — if a feature is still in flight, epic validation is premature. The skill checks before delegating.
- **Product branch supports a re-run loop.** Each invocation produces an updated report; the user fixes findings and re-invokes. The QA sub-agent is stateless across invocations — that's by design (fresh context every time).
