# Design PostClose hook architecture

# Design PostClose hook architecture

## Problem statement

Closing a work unit (task → done, feature close, epic close) should trigger a review of upstream docs for drift, but no mechanism exists today. A "PostClose hook" needs to be designed within the constraints of YAGNI — without adding plugin-level Claude Code hook plumbing when taskman.sh can host the hook directly.

## Scope

In scope:
- Decide where the hook lives. Approach: extend `taskman.sh` to emit a "doc-sync pending" message and append to a queue file after each close action. taskman.sh itself IS the hook — no Claude Code plugin-hook configuration required.
- Define the queue file: `tasks/docs-sync-queue.txt`, one line per pending entry: `<ISO-timestamp> <kind> <id-or-path>`.
- Add `emit_docs_sync_hint()` helper to taskman.sh; call from `cmd_move` (when target=done), `cmd_feature_close`, `cmd_epic_close`.
- Add a queue-check hint to `cmd_list_*` commands so users see pending entries whenever they list state.
- Update `taskman.sh help` usage to document the queue and hint mechanism.

Out of scope:
- Creating the `/agn:docs-sync` skill itself (sibling task).
- SessionStart auto-surfacing via Claude Code hooks (sibling task — handled as opt-in documentation).

## Acceptance criteria

- `taskman.sh move <path> done`, `feature close <slug>`, `epic close <slug>` each append to `tasks/docs-sync-queue.txt`.
- Each close action prints a "Doc-sync pending. Run /agn:docs-sync" hint on success.
- `taskman.sh list epics|features|tasks` prints a "N doc-sync entries pending" hint to stderr if the queue is non-empty.
- Queue file format is documented in `taskman.sh help`.

## Quality gates

- `taskman.sh validate` passes after changes.
- A test close action (move a task to done) creates an entry in `tasks/docs-sync-queue.txt`.
- A test list action prints the pending-entries hint when the queue is non-empty.

## Summary

### Steps completed

1. Added `DOCS_SYNC_QUEUE` variable to taskman.sh's directory configuration block (resolves to `${TASKS_DIR}/docs-sync-queue.txt`).
2. Added two helper functions: `emit_docs_sync_hint(kind, id)` — appends to the queue file, prints "Doc-sync pending" INFO message. `check_docs_sync_queue()` — prints a WARN message with the queue count if the queue is non-empty.
3. Injected `emit_docs_sync_hint` calls at three close points:
   - `cmd_move` when `target_state == done` → emits with kind=task.
   - `cmd_feature_close` after `yaml_set_field ... status done` → emits with kind=feature.
   - `cmd_epic_close` after `yaml_set_field ... status done` → emits with kind=epic.
4. Injected `check_docs_sync_queue` at the end of `cmd_list` (dispatch wrapper) — covers all 3 list subcommands without duplicating the call.
5. Extended `taskman.sh help` output with a new "DOC-SYNC QUEUE (PostClose hook)" section: file path, line format, example block, processing instructions, observability-record framing.
6. **Tested end-to-end:** moved 3 tasks to done — queue accumulated 3 entries, INFO hint printed each time. Ran `list features` — WARN hint surfaced "3 doc-sync entries pending".

### Changes made

Modified:
- `plugins/agn/scripts/taskman.sh` (1 variable, 2 helpers, 4 call sites, 1 help section)

### Notable decisions

- **taskman.sh IS the hook — no Claude Code plugin-hook plumbing.** Adding a `hooks.json` or `.claude/hooks/` configuration would couple this feature to Claude Code's hook mechanism. taskman.sh emitting the message has identical user-visible effect (Claude sees the INFO line via Bash tool output; direct CLI users see it on stderr) without adding new infrastructure. YAGNI wins.
- **Hint on `cmd_list` only, not on every command.** Lists are the natural "look at state" entry point — that's when users want context about pending work. Printing the hint on every command (e.g., `validate`, `new`) would be noise.
- **Queue is append-only, line-oriented.** No JSON, no per-entry files. A 5-line bash helper writes; `/agn:docs-sync` reads with the standard line tools. Format is stable and inspectable.
- **`mkdir -p ${TASKS_DIR}` before appending.** Defensive — first invocation in a fresh repo would otherwise fail if the tasks directory doesn't exist yet. Cheap.
