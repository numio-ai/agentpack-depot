# Wire design skill to Planner

# Wire design skill to Planner

## Problem statement

`/agn:design epic` and `/agn:design feature` are placeholders pending the Planner. They should perform focused design revisions on existing units by delegating to the Planner in refine mode.

## Scope

In scope:
- Edit `plugins/agn/skills/design/SKILL.md`.
- Replace epic and feature placeholders with delegation steps that call the Planner with `mode=refine, level=<level>, path=<existing unit>`.
- Keep the product branch as-is (architecture.md drafting still happens in the parent).
- Define the user-facing flow: locate existing unit → call Planner refine → present diff → write back via taskman.sh (status preservation, no folder move).

Out of scope:
- The product branch's architecture.md flow.
- The Planner system prompt (covered by `create_planner_subagent`).
- Define and plan skills (sibling tasks).

## Acceptance criteria

- Epic branch delegates to Planner in refine mode.
- Feature branch delegates to Planner in refine mode.
- Refinement does not create a new unit — it operates on the existing file's body.
- Product branch unchanged.

## Quality gates

- Skill body parses as markdown; YAML frontmatter intact.
- Each branch has explicit dispatch logic.

## Summary

### Steps completed

1. Updated YAML `description` to drop "once the planner_subagent feature ships" — Planner ships in this same feature.
2. Replaced epic placeholder with a 6-step refinement workflow: Locate → Identify gap → Delegate to Planner (refine mode) → User review → In-place persist via Edit → Report. Added Discipline notes (no folder moves, redirect re-decomposition to `/agn:plan epic`).
3. Replaced feature placeholder with the parallel feature-level workflow (locate, identify, delegate, review, persist, report; includes linked spec in the upstream list and as a possible edit target).
4. Product branch left untouched (architecture.md drafting works in parent session as before).

### Changes made

Modified:
- `plugins/agn/skills/design/SKILL.md` (3 surgical edits: YAML description + 2 placeholders)

### Notable decisions

- **Refinement is in-place.** The design skill edits the existing file's body sections directly; no new unit, no folder move, no slug change. This matches the user expectation that `/agn:design` doesn't restart the lifecycle.
- **Design ≠ Plan, made explicit in Discipline.** Each branch redirects "I want to add/remove features" to `/agn:plan`. Keeps the two skills from drifting into the same job.
