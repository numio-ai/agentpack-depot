# Refactor define skill to delegate to Planner

# Refactor define skill to delegate to Planner

## Problem statement

`/agn:define <level>` composes work-unit bodies inline. Composition logic should live in the Planner sub-agent so the parent session only orchestrates dialog + persistence.

## Scope

In scope:
- Edit `plugins/agn/skills/define/SKILL.md`.
- For each of the 4 branches (product, epic, feature, task), replace the inline body-composition step ("Compose the body" / "Compose bodies" / "Compose the epic body") with a delegation step that calls the Planner sub-agent.
- Preserve: argument validation, user interview structure, slug confirmation, taskman.sh calls, finalize/discard flow, reporting step.
- Document the delegation contract: parent passes `{level, mode=new, title, scope, upstream}` to Planner; receives `{body, decomposition}` back.

Out of scope:
- Plan or design skills (sibling tasks).
- Changing taskman.sh.
- Adding Planner-side capabilities (covered by `create_planner_subagent`).

## Acceptance criteria

- Each branch invokes the Planner via the Agent tool before persisting.
- User-interview sections remain intact.
- Composition step explicitly cites: input shape, output shape, what to do with Planner's `Questions for parent` (if any).
- Skill still works without the Planner running — falls back to a clear error rather than partial state.

## Quality gates

- `head` shows valid YAML frontmatter unchanged.
- Each branch contains a delegation step.
- File parses as markdown.

## Summary

### Steps completed

1. Added a new top-level section "Composition via the Planner sub-agent" right after Dispatch — documents the brief shape (level, mode, title, initial_scope, upstream) and the Planner's output contract (`## Body`, `## Decomposition`, optional `## Questions for parent`).
2. Replaced inline body-composition step in 4 places:
   - Epic branch step 5 (was "Compose the epic body"): delegates to Planner with level=epic.
   - Feature branch step 6 (was "Compose bodies"): delegates to Planner with level=feature, then iterates with level=task per child.
   - Task branch step 6 (was "Compose the body"): delegates with level=task, mode=new.
   - Bug branch step 6 (was "Compose the body" with bug-specific framing): delegates with level=task, mode=new, kind=bug in initial_scope.
3. Product branch unchanged in behavior; added one-line note that the Planner is not invoked here — vision/spec/requirements stay in the parent session.

### Changes made

Modified:
- `plugins/agn/skills/define/SKILL.md` (6 surgical edits)

### Notable decisions

- **Composition contract documented once at the top, not repeated per branch.** Keeps DRY; each branch's delegation step is a short pointer to the shared section rather than restating the brief shape four times.
- **Product branch intentionally excluded from Planner delegation.** Vision/spec/requirements are pre-Design — the Planner's mandate starts at architecture. Documented inline so future readers don't add product-level delegation by mistake.
- **`kind=bug` carried in the `initial_scope` field, not as a separate Planner brief slot.** Avoided expanding the contract for a single edge case. The `--kind bug` flag still belongs on the `taskman.sh new task` call.
