# Create Planner sub-agent

# Create Planner sub-agent

## Problem statement

`/agn:define <level>` currently bundles Design + Plan inside the parent session and loads all composition rules into the parent context. A level-aware Planner sub-agent encapsulates Design + Plan, isolates rules, and returns composed content as text for the parent to persist.

## Scope

In scope:
- Create `plugins/agn/agents/planner.md` (new `agents/` directory).
- YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`).
- System prompt covering Design + Plan for product, epic, feature, task tiers.
- Output shape: `## Body` + `## Decomposition` (decomposition empty for task tier).
- Pointers to `rules/task-composition.md`, `rules/first-principles.md`, `rules/writing-guideline.md`.

Out of scope:
- Wiring define/design/plan skills to invoke the Planner (sibling tasks).
- Hook integration; QA-related agents.

## Acceptance criteria

- File `plugins/agn/agents/planner.md` exists with valid YAML frontmatter.
- `tools` field omits Write, Edit, Bash, TodoWrite, KillShell, BashOutput.
- System prompt has explicit per-level guidance for product, epic, feature, task.
- System prompt forbids writing files and calling taskman.sh.
- Rule pointers resolve relative to the plugin root.

## Quality gates

- `head plugins/agn/agents/planner.md` shows valid YAML frontmatter.
- Markdown body parses (no broken fenced blocks).
- `./plugins/agn/scripts/taskman.sh validate` still passes.

## Summary

### Steps completed

1. Created the `plugins/agn/agents/` directory (no prior agents).
2. Wrote `plugins/agn/agents/planner.md` (~120 lines) with: YAML frontmatter, identity, invocation contract, output shape, per-level guidance (product / epic / feature / task), rule pointers, hard constraints.
3. Restricted `tools` to read-only set (Read, Glob, Grep, LS, NotebookRead, WebFetch, WebSearch) — no Write/Edit/Bash/TodoWrite/KillShell/BashOutput.
4. `taskman.sh validate` passes.

### Changes made

Created:
- `plugins/agn/agents/planner.md`
- `plugins/agn/agents/` (new directory)

### Notable decisions

- **Product-level scope clarified.** The Planner handles architecture (Design) + epic decomposition (Plan) for product. Vision/spec/requirements drafting stays in `/agn:define product`'s parent session — those are pre-Design and not the Planner's concern.
- **`Questions for parent` escape hatch.** Sub-agents cannot ask the user directly; the Planner returns questions as a section in its output, and the parent session relays them. Avoids the "sub-agent guesses silently" failure mode.
- **One unit per invocation.** Decomposition entries become sibling Planner invocations from the parent, not a single mega-call. Keeps each sub-agent context focused.
