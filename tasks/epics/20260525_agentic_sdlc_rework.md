# Agentic SDLC rework — recursive workflow, unified skills, role separation


## Problem statement

The plugin's skill surface conflates phases that should be distinct (`epic-create` bundles Design and Plan). Validation runs in the same context as implementation, so the agent that wrote the code also tests it — inheriting the implicit context that biased its design choices. No protocol exists for handling upstream design gaps discovered mid-implementation; agents either improvise silently or stop without structured handoff. No mechanism keeps product docs current after work closes; architecture and specs drift.

## Objective

A recursive SDLC where every tier (product → epic → feature → task) runs the same six phases: Requirements → Spec → Design → Plan → Implementation → Validation. Skills follow a verb-noun pattern (`/agn:<verb> <level>`). Planner and QA sub-agents enforce role separation. An escalation protocol routes upstream design gaps. A PostClose hook keeps docs current automatically.

## Scope

In scope:
- Verb-noun skill renaming; single skill per verb with level as argument.
- One level-aware Planner sub-agent for Design + Plan at all tiers.
- QA sub-agent for feature/epic/product validation; lightweight `/agn:validate task` skill.
- Escalation protocol in `/agn:implement task` with gap-log capture.
- PostClose hook + `/agn:docs-sync` skill.
- Rule file reorganization (`task-composition.md`, `qa.md`, `doc-maintenance.md`); persistence centralized in `taskman.sh help`.
- Cleanup of `session-load` skill, `stc` agent fossils, `settings.json.disabled`.

Out of scope:
- Feedback-loop infrastructure for autonomous task design. Tracked as separate backlog task; depends on this epic's escalation gap-logs accumulating.
- Behavioral changes to workflow rules beyond what role separation requires.

## Acceptance criteria

- All lifecycle skills follow `/agn:<verb> <level>` (verbs: define, design, plan, implement, validate; levels: product/epic/feature/task as applicable). Tool skills (`code-review`, `code-comment`, `code-commit`) unchanged.
- Planner sub-agent handles Design + Plan at every tier; invoked by `/agn:define <level>` and standalone `/agn:design`/`/agn:plan <level>` skills.
- QA sub-agent handles feature/epic/product validation; sees spec + result only, not implementer reasoning. `/agn:validate task` is light, runs in main session.
- `/agn:implement task` halts on detected design gaps; writes durable gap-log; surfaces routing instructions to user.
- PostClose hook fires on `taskman.sh` close commands; `/agn:docs-sync` proposes upstream doc diffs; user reviews before commit.
- Rule files reorganized; persistence rules in `taskman.sh help`; `taskman.sh validate` passes; README import block updated.
- `session-load` skill directory deleted; `settings.json.disabled` deleted; spec and README scrubbed of `stc` agent references.

## Linked features

1. `unified_skills_and_cleanup`
2. `rules_split_and_new_files`
3. `planner_subagent`
4. `task_escalation_protocol`
5. `qa_subagent_and_validation`
6. `docsync_close_hook`

## Summary

### Steps completed

The epic decomposed into 6 features, executed in dependency order over multiple sessions. Each feature shipped with its own commit, task summaries, and doc-sync — closing left CLAUDE.md / README / agn-specification.md in a consistent state at every checkpoint.

1. **`unified_skills_and_cleanup`** — Verb-noun skill surface live. Skills consolidated from 13 to 8 (5 lifecycle + 3 tool), each routed by `$0` positional argument. Abandoned fossils (`session-load` skill, `stc` agent references, `settings.json.disabled`) removed.
2. **`rules_split_and_new_files`** — Composition rules in `rules/task-composition.md` (split from the old `task-management.md`); persistence centralized in `taskman.sh help`; new role-specific rules `rules/qa.md` and `rules/doc-maintenance.md` authored. CLAUDE.md and `plugins/agn/README.md` import blocks updated to the 5-file set.
3. **`planner_subagent`** — First sub-agent in the plugin. `plugins/agn/agents/planner.md` is a level-aware Design + Plan composer with read-only tools. `/agn:define` (epic/feature/task), `/agn:design` (epic/feature), `/agn:plan` (epic/feature) delegate composition; product-level `/agn:define` keeps vision/spec/requirements drafting in the parent session (pre-Design).
4. **`task_escalation_protocol`** — `/agn:implement task` halts on detected design gaps, writes a gap-log entry to `tasks/gaps/`, prints a routing message, and supports resume. New step 0 (resume check) and step 3 (gap detection) in the task Execution steps; gap-log format documented in the skill itself.
5. **`qa_subagent_and_validation`** — Second sub-agent. `plugins/agn/agents/qa.md` is a fresh-context validator that loads `rules/qa.md`. `/agn:validate task` runs lightweight gates in the main session; `/agn:validate feature|epic|product` delegate to QA. Existing qa-integration / qa-system content migrated and audited — no logic dropped.
6. **`docsync_close_hook`** — Final feature. `taskman.sh` emits a PostClose hook on every close action (move done, feature close, epic close), appending to `tasks/docs-sync-queue.txt`. `/agn:docs-sync` skill processes the queue, walks the dependency chain per `rules/doc-maintenance.md`, proposes diffs, applies after user approval, clears entries.

### Changes made

The plugin now ships:

- 9 skills: `define`, `design`, `plan`, `implement`, `validate` (lifecycle); `code-review`, `code-comment`, `code-commit`, `docs-sync` (tool).
- 2 sub-agents: `planner` (read-only tools, Design + Plan composer), `qa` (full tools, fresh-context validator).
- 5 rule files: `first-principles.md`, `task-composition.md`, `writing-guideline.md`, `qa.md`, `doc-maintenance.md`.
- `scripts/taskman.sh` as the single writer for task state, with PostClose hook for doc-sync queue.
- Observability storage: `tasks/gaps/` for design-gap escalation logs; `tasks/docs-sync-queue.txt` for the doc-sync queue.

Across the epic, ~22 child tasks closed, 6 features closed, 6 commits land on `main`.

### Notable decisions or deviations

- **Sub-agents isolate by context, not always by tool restriction.** Planner has read-only tools because its job depends on not writing (composition rules ride in via the prompt; parent persists). QA has full tools because it needs to run tests and apply in-scope glue fixes; its role boundary lives in the prompt + `rules/qa.md`. Different constraint patterns; both honest.
- **taskman.sh hosts the PostClose hook directly** rather than configuring a Claude Code plugin-level hook. Simplest viable design — taskman's INFO line surfaces via Bash tool output in Claude sessions, on stderr in direct CLI use. Identical user-visible effect, fewer moving parts.
- **Observability records carved out of "taskman is the sole writer".** `tasks/gaps/` (design-gap log) and `tasks/docs-sync-queue.txt` (PostClose queue) are written by the skill / by taskman itself respectively, not through `taskman.sh new`. Documented in CLAUDE.md as a deliberate exception with two reasons: (1) they're observability records, not lifecycle units; (2) the validation function explicitly only walks lifecycle folders.
- **/agn:define product is the only branch where the Planner is NOT invoked.** Vision/spec/requirements drafting is pre-Design; the Planner's mandate starts at architecture (which lives in `/agn:design product`). Documented inline so future readers don't add product delegation by mistake.
- **Halt on QA "not ready" — never auto-advance lifecycle.** Validate skills cannot offer `feature close`, `epic close`, or release sign-off when QA says not ready. Forces user triage rather than silent advancement.
- **Each feature closed with synced docs.** Every checkpoint left CLAUDE.md, plugins/agn/README.md, and docs/agn-specification.md updated to reflect the current ship state. The "in flight" section ticked down 6 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 0 across the run; at epic close it converted to "Architecture rework complete".

### Risks surfaced (unresolved)

- **Sub-agent invocation name resolution.** Both `planner` and `qa` are invoked via `subagent_type: <name>`. The exact resolution at Claude Code runtime (whether plain `planner` or `agn:planner` is correct for plugin-namespaced agents) was not empirically verified — first real `/agn:define epic` or `/agn:validate feature` invocation will exercise this. Both agents are documented abstractly so either resolution works with a single rename.
- **Gap-queue scaling.** `/agn:implement task` resume protocol scans `tasks/gaps/` linearly on every invocation. Fine for short-lived projects; if hundreds of resolved gaps accumulate, consider archiving or indexing.
- **`taskman.sh` still lacks a backlog → active transition for epics and features.** Tasks have `move backlog active`; epics and features must have their `status` YAML edited by hand (or use a different skill). Surfaced repeatedly across feature summaries (`unified_skills_and_cleanup`, `rules_split_and_new_files`). Not blocking — direct YAML edit is safe — but the cleanest fix is adding `epic activate` / `feature activate` commands. Worth a backlog task.
