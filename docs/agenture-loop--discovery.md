### [Maintanance] - Code Simplify

Simplify and optimize complex codebase. As codebase growing it accumulates maintainability problems. Things to watch on codebase: 
- Must be well structured and consistent. Same naming patterns. If package or directory contains more than 10-20 files it may require to add subpackages to group related sources
- It must be maintainable - consistent naming conventions, adherance to conventions and architecture patterns
- No redudancies, no orphan unused code
- Complete test coverage
- Documentation aligned with latest code. No dangling or outdated documents. No redundant documents

To Do


Chat Customizations Evaluations

An extension for analyzing and improving AI prompt files. Works with .prompt.md, .agent.md, SKILL.md, and .instructions.md files — providing LLM-powered semantic analysis directly in VS Code.

Features
- LLM-Powered Analysis (via GitHub Copilot)
- Contradiction Detection — Finds logical, behavioral, and format conflicts
- Semantic Ambiguity — Ambiguity analysis with rewrite suggestions
- Persona Consistency — Detects conflicting personality traits and tone drift
- Cognitive Load Assessment — Warns about overly complex prompts with too many nested conditions
- Semantic Coverage — Identifies gaps in intent handling and missing error paths
- Composition Conflict Analysis — Detects conflicts between a prompt and other prompt files it imports via markdown links

Waza Integration
- Create Eval Scaffold — Generates eval files for a skill via waza new eval <skill-name>
- Run Evaluation — Executes skill evaluation via waza run <eval.yaml> --context-dir <skill-dir>
- Automatic Local Fallback — If waza is not on PATH, commands attempt a local fallback via go run ./cmd/waza when a sibling waza repo is available

Editor Integration
- Editor Title Bar — Analyze Prompt button appears when editing prompt files
- Command Palette — Chat Customizations Evaluations: Analyze Prompt command
- Problems Panel — All diagnostics appear in the standard VS Code Problems panel with precise line and column locations

Supported File Types
Pattern	Type
- *.prompt.md	Prompt
- *.agent.md	Agent
- *.instructions.md	Instructions

Usage
Open any supported prompt file in VS Code
    Run Chat Customizations Evaluations: Analyze Prompt from the command palette or click the beaker icon in the editor title bar
    View results in the Problems panel (Ctrl+Shift+M / Cmd+Shift+M)
    LLM analysis requires GitHub Copilot — no API keys needed. Just sign in to GitHub Copilot in VS Code.
